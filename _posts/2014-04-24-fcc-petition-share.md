## Thank you!

> FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, stand up for consumers against big corporations like Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon, by rejecting a pay to play “fast lane.” The FCC should take immediate action to classify broadband Internet as a public utility, not a luxury, preserving a free and open Internet for everyone.

*Share this petition and ask everyone you know to sign.* We can make real progress if we work together.
