## Join us for a Fresh Start in South Jersey!

The hard work of fighting for economic opportunity and a strong middle class begins in South Jersey. This campaign is based on a simple belief:

> Everyone who wants a job should be able to find one. And everyone who works hard should be able to provide for their families. That’s a strong middle class, and it’s what I’m fighting for. 

**If you believe this too, take a stand and join the campaign.**

South Jersey is still hurting from the economic downturn. Middle class families have been hit with layoffs, shrinking paychecks, and fewer hours on the job - and it’s harder than ever for those families to get back on their feet. It's time for a fresh start.
