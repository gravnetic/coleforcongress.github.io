## Demand that millionaires and giant corporations pay their fair share of taxes

I support the Congressional Progressive Caucus budget, and call on those who want to represent us in Congress to do the same.

Congressman LoBiondo's party proposes cutting Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid benefits – all while lowering taxes on millionaires and giant corporations.

**Congressional Republicans try to dominate the news around April 15 tax day. But this year, I’m standing with other bold progressive candidates and going on offense!**

Add your name so Rep. LoBiondo hears the message loud and clear: "Demand millionaires and corporations pay their fair share!"
