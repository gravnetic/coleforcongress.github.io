## Spread the word: Big announcement next week

Next week, the hard work of fighting for economic opportunity and a strong middle class begins in South Jersey. Dave will announce the start of his campaign for Congress in New Jersey's 2nd District.

**Sign up to be the first to hear the announcement.**

Dave's campaign is based on a simple belief: 

> Everyone who wants a job should be able to find one. And everyone who works hard should be able to provide for their families. That's a strong middle class, and it's what I'm fighting for.

**If you believe this too, take a stand with Dave.**

South Jersey is still hurting from the economic downturn. Middle class families have been hit with layoffs, shrinking paychecks, and fewer hours on the job — and it's harder than ever for those families to get back on their feet. It’s time for a fresh start.
